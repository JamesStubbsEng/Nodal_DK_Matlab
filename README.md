# Nodal_DK_Matlab
Nodal DK Method applied to various circuits

Todo:
1) investigate/improve damped NR equation. Possibly could improve overshooting number of iterations.
2) pnp ed in matlab vs in spice
3) pnp ce in matlab vs in spice
4) add potentiometers to existing models in matlab and spice
5) Fuzz face in matlab and spice
6) Fuzz face in juce using Eigen for matrix maths
